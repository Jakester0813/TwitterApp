# Project 4 - *TwitterApp*

**TwitterApp** is an android app that allows a user to view home and mentions timelines, view user profiles with user timelines, as well as compose and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index).

Time spent: **x** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x]	User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
* [x]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [x] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
  * [x] User can view more tweets as they scroll with [infinite pagination](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView). Number of tweets is unlimited.
    However there are [Twitter Api Rate Limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) in place.
* [x] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  * [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  * [x] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
* [x] User can **switch between Timeline and Mention views using tabs**
  * [x] User can view their home timeline tweets.
  * [x] User can view the recent mentions of their username.
* [x] User can navigate to **view their own profile**
  * [X] User can see picture, tagline, # of followers, # of following, and tweets on their profile.
* [x] User can **click on the profile image** in any tweet to see **another user's** profile.
 * [x] User can see picture, tagline, # of followers, # of following, and tweets of clicked user.
 * [x] Profile view includes that user's timeline
* [x] User can [infinitely paginate](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView) any of these timelines (home, mentions, user) by scrolling to the bottom

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet** on compose tweet page
* [x] User can **click a link within a tweet body** on tweet details view. The click will launch the web browser with relevant page opened.
* [x] User can **pull down to refresh tweets timeline**
* [x] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.
* [x] User can tap a tweet to **open a detailed tweet view**
    * [x] User can take favorite (and unfavorite) or retweet actions on a tweet
* [x] User can **select "reply" from detail view to respond to a tweet**
* [x] User can view following / followers list through the profile
* [x] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [x] When a network request is sent, user sees an [indeterminate progress indicator](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-ProgressBars#progress-within-actionbar)
* [x] User can **"reply" to any tweet on their home timeline**
  * [x] The user that wrote the original tweet is automatically "@" replied in compose
* [x] User can **search for tweets matching a particular query** and see results
* [x] Usernames and hashtags are styled and clickable within tweets [using clickable spans](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Working-with-the-TextView#creating-clickable-styled-spans)


The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Compose tweet functionality is build using modal overlay
* [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [x] [Leverage RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) as a replacement for the ListView and ArrayAdapter for all lists of tweets.
* [x] Move the "Compose" action to a [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Floating-Action-Buttons) instead of on the AppBar.
* [x] On the Twitter timeline, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to apply scrolling behavior that [hides / shows the toolbar](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll).
* [x] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [ ] Enable your app to [receive implicit intents](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Intents-to-Create-Flows#receiving-implicit-intents) from other apps.  When a link is shared from a web browser, it should pre-fill the text and title of the web page when composing a tweet.
* [x] When a user leaves the compose view without publishing and there is existing text, prompt to save or delete the draft.  The draft can be resumed from the compose view.
* [x] On the profile screen, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to [apply scrolling behavior](https://hackmd.io/s/SJyDOCgU) as the user scrolls through the profile timeline.
* [ ] User can view their direct messages (or send new ones)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] (F)Improve the user interface and theme the app to feel **Twitter branded**
* [x] If the tweet is in reply to another tweet, show the user that the tweet is responding to
* [x] The User is able to retweet or favorite any tweet on the home timeline

Fixes to do list:
* [ ] Add borders for recyclerviews
* [ ] Alignment is off for retweet on Home Timeline
* [ ] New Tweet dialog could use some touching up
* [ ] Reply to is pretty buggy
* [ ] Favorite/Retweet count is not consistent between details and timeline
* [ ] Add background for profiles that don't have a image
* [ ] Search bar needs to be fixed to not remove profile icon

## Notes

Learning the OAuth aspect of the app was a challenge for me. Once I figured out how the flow is supposed to work, it because much easier to manage.

## Open-source libraries used

 * [scribe-java](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java) - Simple OAuth library for handling the authentication flow.
 * [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
 * [codepath-oauth](https://github.com/thecodepath/android-oauth-handler) - Custom-built library for managing OAuth authentication and signing of requests
 * [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Used for async image loading and caching them in memory and on disk.
 * [DBFlow](https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow) - Simple ORM for persisting a local SQLite database on the Android device
